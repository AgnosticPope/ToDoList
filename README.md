# ToDoList
A to do list where entries are sorted by priority value. 
This will start out as a heap priority queue, then I will rewrite it as a sorted list. Next I will add additional functionality. Finally I will address saving and restoring the files. 

I am currently at work so I will have to upload the source files at a later time.
