# ToDoList
A menu-driven program that manages 3 to do lists. Entries are sorted by priority value and contained/managed by a heap priority queue. Each queue is managed by a file manager object that is responsible for loading, saving, and building the queues.

Current status: Considering what classes are needed for inheritance for the Heap Priority Queue. I am looking at class heap, class priority queue interface. Also considering what type of inheritance or composition is going to be used.
